WDIR Hopper Project 1 - Memory Game

This game is build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  I borrowed a lot of images from internet.

The HTML file (index.html) contains html tags that would display in the browser.
The CSS file ( main.css) contains the format for the page.
The two js files (app.js and app_2.js) contains the control of the game.

The development approach are:
1. One player, one level game, one type of cards
2. One player, multiple level game, one type of cards
3. One player, multiple level game, three type of cards
4. Two players, one round game, one type of cards, one set card numbers.
5. Two players, one round game, three type of cards, three set card numbers to select.
6. Two players, three rounds games, three type of cards and numbers to select.
7. Play against computer.

There are sub-steps within each approach based on the game flow and control functions.

'Play against computer' part is unfinished.

Have fun!
